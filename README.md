# RawTherapee snap

This is a snap of [RawTherapee](http://www.rawtherapee.com).

Rather than being a raster graphics editor such as Photoshop or GIMP,
it is specifically aimed at raw photo post-production.
And it does it very well - at a minimum, RawTherapee is one
of the most powerful raw processing programs available.
